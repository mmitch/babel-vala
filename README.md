Vala support for Babel
======================

This project has been merged to Org!
------------------------------------

`ob-vala.el` has been accepted in upstream [Org] starting with
version 9.1.  Org in turn is part of the official [Emacs] releases, so
`ob-vala.el` will show up there as well.  As of now, this repository
is outdated and will not be updated.  Please refer to the [Org]
project instead.


Good news, but what is this all about?
--------------------------------------

[Vala] is a programming language for the GObject system (think Glib
and GTK) that is converted to C source code and then compiled.

[Babel] is an [Emacs] package that allows to run code directly from
within an [Org] text file.

`ob-vala.el` adds Vala support to Babel.
